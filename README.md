- 👋 Hi, I’m @aspimaker.
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics in general, microcontrollers in particular.
- 🌱 I am currently learning everything, every day!! 95% of what I do is in vb.net. The rest of the things I do are in Processing, for Arduino and ESP32.
- 💞️ For now I'm not looking for collaborations. I have to do/finish a lot of things to be able to do anything around here.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like everything that has to do with drones and airplanes (especially designing and building them - electronics included), 3D printing, CNC for cutting, drilling and milling (especially for creating PCBs).
